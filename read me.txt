I was caring in this prototype for "buiding system" & "camera movement" & "UI buttons" during building Madenti project and still not completed yet.

gameplay instructions:

Download and run 'Madenti.exe' OR see the animated GIF instead.

Right click: disable choosen building.
Left click: choose building and build choosen building.
Mouse Wheel: zoom in zoom out and dragging the camera.
